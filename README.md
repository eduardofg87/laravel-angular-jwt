PHP Laravel API (**backend**) + Angular (**frontend**) + JWT Authentication

#### LARAVEL
Laravel is a free, open-source PHP web framework, created by Taylor Otwell and intended for the development of web applications following the model–view–controller (MVC) architectural pattern and based on Symfony. Some of the features of Laravel are a modular packaging system with a dedicated dependency manager, different ways for accessing relational databases, utilities that aid in application deployment and maintenance, and its orientation toward syntactic sugar.

The source code of Laravel is hosted on GitHub and licensed under the terms of MIT License.

#### ANGULAR
Angular (commonly referred to as "Angular 2+" or "Angular v2 and above") is a TypeScript-based open-source full-stack web application framework led by the Angular Team at Google and by a community of individuals and corporations. Angular is a complete rewrite from the same team that built AngularJS.

#### JWT
JSON Web Tokens are an open, industry standard RFC 7519 method for representing claims securely between two parties.

JWT.IO allows you to decode, verify and generate JWT.

#### BOOTSTRAP
Bootstrap is a free and open-source front-end Web framework. It contains HTML and CSS-based design templates for typography, forms, buttons, navigation and other interface components, as well as optional JavaScript extensions. Unlike many earlier web frameworks, it concerns itself with front-end development only.

Bootstrap is the second most-starred project on GitHub, with more than 130,000 stars.
